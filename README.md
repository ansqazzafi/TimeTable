### **Key Considerations for the Project**:

1. **Role-based Access**: Focus on implementing role-based access and permissions correctly from the very beginning. Admin, Doctor, Patient, and Patient Care should have access to only their respective functionalities.
   
2. **User Authentication and Security**: Make sure the JWT authentication is robust and secure, especially for patient and doctor interactions.

3. **Testing**: Unit testing and integration testing are crucial to ensure the system functions as expected, especially for critical modules like **appointments**, **payment gateway**, and **SMS notifications**.

4. **Deployment**: Before deployment, ensure all components (database, API, front-end) are properly integrated and tested in a staging environment. Post-deployment testing is key to ensure there are no issues in the live environment.

This detailed and sequenced timetable should help you stay on track throughout the development process, ensuring that each component is completed before moving on to the next. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
